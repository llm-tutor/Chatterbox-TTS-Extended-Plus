#### **Task 11.6: Fixes and enhancements to API**
- [ ] Fix the error in function 'utils.audio.calculate_audio_duration()'. Invoked from end point 'v1/outputs'. Server logs below. Looking at the specific file on the logs, its size on disk is 0, a corrupted or failed generation. We can do two things. Always check for size in the listing process, if that is effective or economical, and also add to the start up clean up process (set also every 4 hours I think), as to remove files of size 0 from outputs/, voices/ and vc_inputs/ (with sub-folder search inside of each), as to keep clean the files on the system. Of course add each deletion to the logs. Probably doing this makes unnecesary adding operations to each listing call, but let's consider both things.

```
- [ ] Fix **GET** `/api/v1/voices/folders` Docs in `docs/api/endpoints/voice-management.md` Problem maybe related to refactoring (function moved from 'utils.py' to '/utils/voice/organization.py')
- [ ] Add parameter 'folder' to **GET** `/api/v1/outputs`, as to filter by folder path, documentation at `docs/api/endpoints/file-operations.md`. Use **GET** `/api/v1/voices` as reference (look at `docs/api/endpoints/voice-management.md`),
- [ ] Create new end point **GET** `/api/v1/outputs/folders`, to get the folder structure inside 'outputs/', add documentation in `docs/api/endpoints/file-operations.md`. Use **GET** `/api/v1/voices/folders` as reference (`docs/api/endpoints/voice-management.md`),
- [ ] Create new end point **GET** `/api/v1/vc_inputs` to list the files inside 'vc_inputs/'. Implement the same set of parameters used for **GET** `/api/v1/outputs/` documented at `docs/api/endpoints/file-operations.md`. Omit only "generation_type" value from "sort_by", include the new parameter "folder", so we can list files inside a sub-folder of 'vc_inputs/'. Document this new end point also in `docs/api/endpoints/file-operations.md`.
- [ ] Create new end point **GET** `/api/v1/vc_inputs/folders`, to get the folder structure inside 'vc_inputs/', add documentation in `docs/api/endpoints/file-operations.md`. Use **GET** `/api/v1/voices/folders` as reference (`docs/api/endpoints/voice-management.md`).
- [ ] Add the parameter "project" as an alias for "folder", for **GET** `/api/v1/outputs`,  for **GET** `/api/v1/voices`, and for the new **GET** `/api/v1/vc_inputs`.
- [ ] Mention new end points in `api/docs/README.md` if appropriate, or where relevant.

#### **Task 11.7: Improve API documentation**
- [ ] At the top of each document in `docs/api/endpoints`, create a list of all the end points documented in that document, as an index for that document, with general descriptions of each end point. Exception: When the document contains only a single end point we dont need such index, just make it clear it is the only one.

#### **Task 11.8: Add the project parameter for TTS generation**
- [ ] Add the parameter "project" (with alias "folder") to `v1/tts` as a new Core Audio Parameter. When present, the generated files (wav and others requested), will be stored inside the folder or folder hierarchy, inside 'outputs/' indicated by its value. The value should be a valid path (example 'project1', 'myproject2/chapter1', 'book_title/chapter_title/section01', etc). The folder path is created if not existent previously. As before, the return value should contain the url to the formats requested. In JSON mode as defined, in Stream mode in the response header 'X-Alternative-Formats' (main_api.py:261). As a note, document this return value for Stream mode in `docs/api/endpoints/tts.md` if it is not documented already.
- [ ] Add the project parameter to the documentation of the TTS end point.

#### **Task 11.9: Add new endpoint to upload vc_input files**
- [ ] Add the new endpoint **POST** `/api/v1/vc_input`. It will upload a new file to the 'vc_inputs' folder. It will be implemented similarly as how the endpoint **POST** `/api/v1/voice` was. As parameters: `vc_input_file` (the binary file, required), `text` (content of the audio file, optional), `project` or `folder_path` (optional), `overwrite` (boolean, default false). The response will be very similar to the POST v1/voice response, except for name, tags and description fields (instead the 'filename', 'folder_path', 'text' if present, etc).
- [ ] Document new feature in `docs/api/endpoints/file-operations.md`, add a note and reference in `docs/api/endpoints/voice-conversion.md`
- [ ] Mention new end point also in `api/docs/README.md` if appropriate, or where relevant.


#### **Task 11.20: Adjust TTS when speed_factor is specified (audiostretchy)**
- [ ] Review the documentation for audiostretchy, in particular how it is used in 'utils/audio/processing.py'. In this file the function 'apply_speed_factor' (lines 14-86, and then lines 89-158) uses audiostretchy as the first option for altering the tempo of a file. The problem we have, is that this library appears to generate wav files with 64 bits of sample size. For most operations of the system, we need the wav files to be of 32 bit sample size. Review if we can specify this when using audiostretchy, or if we need a further post-processing to convert the file before returning the response.


#### **Task 11.7: Concat Processing Pipeline** 
- [ ] Enhance `utils.concatenate_audio_files()` function for new features
- [ ] Add progress tracking for long operations (silence generation, trimming) check times to see if worth it
- [ ] Implement temporary file management for trim operations
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling / logs for silence notation and trimming
- [ ] Include processing time estimates for complex operations
- [ ] Test memory efficiency with large files and multiple processing steps. Do we need this?

#### **Task 11.8: Integration & Testing** - Several here already done?
- [ ] Add concat results to output metadata system (include silence/trim info)
- [ ] Include concat files in `/api/v1/outputs` listings with processing metadata
- [ ] Test cleanup of temporary processing files (trimmed audio cache)
- [ ] Validate output quality and consistency with new features
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple large files and complex processing
- [ ] **ENHANCEMENT**: Address concatenation test script compatibility
  - **Issue**: `test_curl_examples.py` fails on concat examples with fictional filenames
  - **Solution**: Enhance test script to dynamically substitute real filenames from `/api/v1/outputs`
  - **Alternative**: Create dedicated test-safe concatenation examples section
  - **Current**: Core validation works, comprehensive testing needs enhancement
  - **Priority**: Phase 11.5+ or dedicated test script improvement phase

#### **Testing Focus**
- Audio quality preservation during concatenation
- Memory usage with large file processing
- Mixed format handling and conversion
- Cleanup and resource management

#### **Key Files Modified**
- `main_api.py` - Concatenation endpoint
- `api_models.py` - Concat request/response models
- `utils/concatenation/` - Audio concatenation utilities
- `management/` - Resource cleanup integration

## **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Development Principles**
1. **One Phase at a Time**: Complete each phase fully before proceeding
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test continuously during development
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Never break existing functionality
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error coverage for all new features
5. **Documentation**: Update docs immediately after implementation

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: For new utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints
- **Performance Tests**: For file handling and processing
- **Security Tests**: For upload and validation features
- **Compatibility Tests**: For OpenAI endpoints

### **Quality Gates**
Each phase must pass:
- [ ] All new functionality working correctly
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Adequate test coverage
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Backup**: Full project backup before each phase
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert changes if needed
- **Incremental Commits**: Frequent, small commits with clear messages
- **Testing Environment**: Separate testing from development
