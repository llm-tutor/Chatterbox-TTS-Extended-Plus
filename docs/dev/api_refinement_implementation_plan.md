#### **Task 11.6: Fixes and enhancements to API** ✅
- [x] Fix the error in function 'utils.audio.calculate_audio_duration()' by adding file size check for corrupted files
- [x] Create cleanup system for corrupted files (size 0) - integrated into startup and scheduled cleanup with comprehensive logging
- [x] Fix **GET** `/api/v1/voices/folders` - Updated `get_voice_folder_structure()` to return proper API response format
- [x] Add parameter 'folder' to **GET** `/api/v1/outputs`, as to filter by folder path, with 'project' alias
- [x] Create new end point **GET** `/api/v1/outputs/folders`, to get the folder structure inside 'outputs/'
- [x] Create new end point **GET** `/api/v1/vc_inputs` to list the files inside 'vc_inputs/' with full feature set (pagination, search, folder filtering)
- [x] Create new end point **GET** `/api/v1/vc_inputs/folders`, to get the folder structure inside 'vc_inputs/'
- [x] Add the parameter "project" as an alias for "folder", for **GET** `/api/v1/outputs`, **GET** `/api/v1/voices`, and **GET** `/api/v1/vc_inputs`
- [x] Update OpenAPI specification with all new endpoints and parameters
- [x] Update comprehensive documentation for all new features

#### **Task 11.7: Improve API documentation** ✅
- [x] At the top of each document in `docs/api/endpoints`, create a list of all the end points documented in that document, as an index for that document, with general descriptions of each end point. Exception: When the document contains only a single end point we dont need such index, just make it clear it is the only one.
- [x] Added endpoint indexes to `concatenation.md` (2 endpoints) and `voice-management.md` (6 endpoints)
- [x] Single-endpoint documents (`health.md`, `tts.md`, `voice-conversion.md`) confirmed as not needing indexes
- [x] `file-operations.md` already had proper endpoint index

#### **Task 11.8: Add the project parameter for TTS generation** ✅
- [x] Add the parameter "project" (with alias "folder") to `v1/tts` as a new Core Audio Parameter. When present, the generated files (wav and others requested), will be stored inside the folder or folder hierarchy, inside 'outputs/' indicated by its value. The value should be a valid path (example 'project1', 'myproject2/chapter1', 'book_title/chapter_title/section01', etc). The folder path is created if not existent previously. As before, the return value should contain the url to the formats requested. In JSON mode as defined, in Stream mode in the response header 'X-Alternative-Formats' (main_api.py:261). As a note, document this return value for Stream mode in `docs/api/endpoints/tts.md` if it is not documented already.
- [x] Updated `api_models.py` TTSRequest with project/folder parameters and alias handling
- [x] Modified `core_engine.py` to handle project folder in TTS generation pipeline
- [x] Updated `convert_audio_formats` method to generate correct URLs with project path
- [x] Updated speed factor and trimming post-processing to use project folders

- [x] Documented X-Alternative-Formats header and project folder URL structure
- [x] Added project organization example in TTS documentation
- [x] Updated OpenAPI specification with project/folder parameters

#### **Task 11.9: New endpoints for complete file management**
- [x] Add the new endpoint **POST** `/api/v1/vc_input`. It will upload a new file to the 'vc_inputs' folder. It will be implemented similarly as how the endpoint **POST** `/api/v1/voice` was. As parameters: `vc_input_file` (the binary file, required), `text` (content of the audio file, optional), `project` or `folder_path` (optional), `overwrite` (boolean, default false). The response will be very similar to the POST v1/voice response, except for name, tags and description fields (instead the 'filename', 'folder_path', 'text' if present, etc).
- [x] Mention new end point also in `api/docs/README.md` if appropriate, or where relevant.
- [x] Add end point **DELETE** `/api/v1/output/{filename}` - Delete a single outputs file, filename can include a path structure. Use **DELETE** `/api/v1/voice/{filename}` as reference
- [x] Add end point **DELETE** `/api/v1/vc_input/{filename}` - Delete a single vc_input file, filename can include a path structure. Use **DELETE** `/api/v1/voice/{filename}` as reference
- [x] Add end point **DELETE** `/api/v1/outputs/` - Delete multiple outputs based on criteria (folder, search, filenames). Use **DELETE** `/api/v1/voices` as reference
- [x] Add end point **DELETE** `/api/v1/vc_inputs/` - Delete multiple vc_inputs based on criteria (folder, search, filenames). Use **DELETE** `/api/v1/voices` as reference
- [x] Document new features in `docs/api/endpoints/file-operations.md`
- [x] Add a note and reference in `docs/api/endpoints/voice-conversion.md` mentioning new endpoints
- [x] Add a note and reference in `docs/api/endpoints/tts.md` mentioning new endpoints
- [x] Small, relevant update in `docs/api/README>md`

#### **Task 11.9.1: Small fixes** ✅
- [x] Adjustment to DELETE bulk end points for outputs and vc_inputs: We 
  need to remove the top folder referenced. Example, if we request 
  to delete 'books/chapter1/section1', we should not only delete the files 
  inside 'section1', but also the folder itself 'section1'. This applies 
  both for vc_inputs and outputs folders. This deviates from DELETE voices, 
  since in voices/, empty subfolders can mean empty voice categories. 
  Outputs and vc_inputs sub-folders have no such meaning, so the behavior 
  should be to delete not only the files, but the folder itself. 
- [x] Often we have problems making the right request for v1/tts, when it 
  comes of JSON mode vs Stream mode. Probably because of incomplete, 
  inconsistent documentation. Let's find out what are the right ways to 
  define each of those modes and document it. The file 
  'scripts/test_core_examples.py' should contain working code that we can 
  use as our starting point to define clearly, in all the documents and 
  examples, how to make the call on each of the modes. 
  

#### **Task 11.10: Integrated test for file management** ✅
- [x] Integrated test for: output (tts) generation in folders/projects, reading folders, finding files, deleting files and deleting output folders. Complete workflow test created at `scripts/test_integrated_tts_file_management.py`
- [x] Integrated test for: vc_input (vc) upload in folders/projects, reading folders, finding files, deleting files and deleting vc_inputs/ sub-folders. Complete workflow test created at `scripts/test_integrated_vc_input_management.py`
- [x] Integrated test for: voices, upload in folders, reading folders, finding voices, deleting voices and deleting voices sub-folders. Complete workflow test created at `scripts/test_integrated_voice_management.py`
- [x] All tests demonstrate complete API-based workflows for file management with comprehensive coverage of organizing, searching, and cleanup operations

#### **Task 11.11: Adjust TTS when speed_factor is specified (audiostretchy)** ✅
- [x] Reviewed audiostretchy implementation in `utils/audio/processing.py`
- [x] Identified issue: audiostretchy was generating 64-bit WAV files instead of required 32-bit float
- [x] Fixed by specifying `subtype='FLOAT'` in `sf.write()` and `dtype='float32'` in `sf.read()` - REVERTED
- [x] Added explicit `astype(np.float32)` conversion for additional safety  - REVERTED
- [x] Updated function documentation to reflect the fix (Task 11.11) - REVERTED
- [x] Added debug logging to verify correct precision processing  - REVERTED
- [x] Created test script `scripts/test_audiostretchy_precision.py` to verify the fix - NEED to be tested again

#### **Task 11.11.1 Find alternatives to fix**
- [x] Review the information at `docs/dev/task_11.11_attempted_fix_for_speed_factor_64b_sample_size.md`
- [x] Propose an alternative fix
- [x] Implement the new fix

  - scripts/test_tts_speed_factor_api.py
  - scripts/test_audiostretchy_precision.py
  - scripts/test_audiostretchy_precision_simple.py
- [x] Confirm with the user that the final audio files are acceptable and of 32 bits sample size
- [x] Upon confirmation, create a commit for all the current changes in the repo (they will include the ones from task 11.10, not yet committed)

#### **Task 11.12: Fix integrated test for basic concatenation**
- [x] Fix **GET** `v1/voices` API method: Added 'url' field to VoiceMetadata class containing path relative to reference_audio/ for TTS generation (e.g., 'test_voices/linda_johnson_01.wav', 'speaker_en/Jamie01.mp3'). Modified VoiceMetadata class in api_models.py and voices endpoint in main_api.py to populate this field correctly.
- [x] Adjust the test file `scripts/test_integrated_tts_file_management.py` to use the 'url' field instead of non-existent 'filename' field and fix response structure (voices['voices'] instead of voices['files']).
- [x] Update documentation in `docs/api/schemas/response-models.md` to include the new 'url' field in VoiceMetadata examples with description.
- [x] Test the fixes with server running and ensure the integrated test works correctly
- [x] **MAJOR FIXES**: Resolved multiple cross-platform and API design issues:
  - **Empty project handling**: Fixed project="" to create files in root folder instead of "unnamed" folder
  - **Path separator consistency**: Updated all path handling to use forward slashes across Windows/Linux (outputs, vc_inputs, voices)
  - **Hierarchical folder filtering**: Enhanced filtering to include subfolders (e.g., project=test_book finds files in test_book/chapter1)
  - **Enhanced search functionality**: Search now includes folder paths, not just filenames
  - **DELETE endpoint improvement**: Returns 200 success instead of 404 when no files found to delete
  - **Unicode/emoji compatibility**: Removed emoji characters from test scripts for Windows cp932 encoding compatibility
- [x] **VALIDATION**: TTS integrated test now passes completely - all file management workflows working correctly
- [x] **TODO**: Apply same fixes to VC and Voice integrated tests - check for similar issues:
  - [x] Path separator consistency in folder structures and filtering  
  - [x] Hierarchical folder filtering (parent folder should find subfolders)
  - [x] Search functionality including folder paths
  - [x] DELETE endpoint behavior when no files match criteria
  - [x] Unicode/emoji encoding issues in test scripts
- [x] Proceed and iterate in the same way on the VC integrated test: `scripts/test_integrated_vc_input_management.py`, document it.
- [x] Proceed and iterate in the same way on the Voice integrated test: `scripts/test_integrated_voice_management.py`, document it.
