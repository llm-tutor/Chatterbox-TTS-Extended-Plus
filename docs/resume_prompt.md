# Resume Development Prompt

## Context
I need to continue development of the Chatterbox TTS Extended Plus API implementation project. This is a multi-phase project to add FastAPI-based HTTP API functionality to an existing Gradio-based TTS/VC application.

## Instructions
Please read and analyze the following documents to understand the current project state:

### Primary Context Documents:
1. **Design & Implementation Plan**: `adjusted_implementation_plan_v1.1.md` - Contains the technical implementation strategy
2. **Reference Code**: `consolidated_starting_code_v1.1.md` - Contains starting code templates and implementation patterns
3. **Project Tracking**: `docs/implementation_tracking.md` - Shows current phase, completed tasks, and next steps
4. **Change History**: `docs/changelog.md` - Documents what has been implemented and changed

### Project Location:
- **Working Directory**: `E:\Repos\Chatterbox-TTS-Extended-Plus`
- **Reference Implementation**: `E:\Repos\Chatterbox-TTS-Server` (for comparison/reference)

### Key Tasks:
1. **Read the tracking document** (`docs/implementation_tracking.md`) to understand:
   - Which phase we're currently in
   - What tasks are completed vs. pending
   - What the next actionable steps are

2. **Check the current project state** by examining the working directory structure and existing files

3. **Continue development** from where we left off, following the implementation plan and updating tracking documents as you progress

4. **Maintain documentation** by updating both the tracking document and changelog as tasks are completed

## Expected Response:
Please start by:
1. Reading the tracking document to understand current status
2. Examining the current project structure
3. Identifying the next phase/tasks to work on
4. Beginning implementation while maintaining our documentation standards

## Development Approach:
- Follow the phase-based implementation strategy outlined in the plan
- Update tracking documents as tasks are completed
- Test implementations when appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Chatter.py functionality
- Use the reference TTS-Server implementation for patterns and best practices

---

**Note**: This project follows a systematic, phase-based approach with comprehensive tracking. Please maintain this methodology to ensure consistent progress and documentation.
