## Adding New Test Files

When adding new test input files to this folder:

1. Use short, clear audio samples suitable for automated testing
2. Document the source (recorded, generated, or public domain)
3. Ensure proper licensing for the source material
4. Use descriptive filenames that indicate the source/content
5. Keep files reasonably small for efficient testing
